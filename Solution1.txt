Pseudo Code-

1.Take number of tests as input-T
2.Perform all validity  check on(1<=T<=10)
3.Consider a String Array s[] of size T
4.For a loop in range 0 to (T-1) take Strings to check they are dynamic string or not.
5.Take a loop of range  0 to length of array.
6.Consider another character array as str[].
7.Convert first String of array into array of character and store it into str[] and let resultcount=0;
8.Take a loop of range 0 to length array of character
9.Find occurance of individual character
10.if count>=3 then increase resultcount
11.a)if resultcount>0 then String is dynamic
    b)if resultcount=0 then String is not dynamic.
